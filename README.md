Drug Discovery Powered by AI

 Unlocking Hidden Cures: AI at the Frontier of Drug Discovery and Repurposing.
Problem Statement
 
Millions of individuals with rare diseases suffer from a lack of effective treatments, 
exacerbated by the high costs and slow progress of traditional drug discovery methods. 

Our goal is to leverage AI-powered solutions to accelerate the discovery and repurposing 
of drugs, providing affordable, timely, and accessible treatments for under-served 
populations.


Approach

 Data Collection & Preparation:

 ● Utilize bioactivity data from ChEMBL..

 ● Extract molecular structures, bioactivity metrics (e.g., IC50, EC50), and targets.

 ● Clean and preprocess data using RDKit to generate molecular descriptors

 ● Prepare molecular representations suitable for AI and GAN-based modeling (e.g., SMILES 
strings, molecular graphs).


 AI Model Development:

 ● Train regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for bioactivity prediction.

 ● Develop classification models to estimate drug success probability.

 ● Apply optimization techniques like GridSearchCV for model tuning.

● GAN Integration: 

○  Generator: Create novel molecular structures (SMILES strings, graphs) as new drug 
candidates.

 ○  Discriminator: Evaluate the generated molecules based on predicted bioactivity, 
drug-likeness, and similarity to known drugs.


 Molecular Visualization :
 ● SMILES Strings to Structures: Generate and display molecular structures from SMILES 
strings using  RDKit.

 ● New Drug Candidates : Visualize GAN-generated molecules alongside known compounds, 
showing bioactivity predictions and drug success estimates


Drug Repurposing:

 ● Perform *Tanimoto similarity searches* to identify potential repurposed drugs.

 ● Leverage GAN-generated molecules as additional candidates for repurposing, based on 
their similarity to existing drugs and predicted bioactivity.


 Web Interface:

 User-Friendly Interface: 

●  Input disease data and display predictions, including drug formulas and success rates.

 ●   Display molecular structures with visualizations (RDKit).

 ●   Show suggested repurposed drugs based on molecular similarity and GAN-generated 
candidates.


Benefits of GAN Integration:

 ● Novel Drug Discovery: Generate new drug-like molecules with the potential to treat 
rare diseases.

 ● Accelerated Drug Repurposing: Enhance the identification of repurposed drugs 
through molecular similarity searches, including GAN-generated molecules.

 ● Affordable Treatments: Speed up the process of drug discovery and repurposing to 
make treatments more affordable and accessible to underserved populations.
